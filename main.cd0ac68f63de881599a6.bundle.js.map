License plate said \"fresh\" and had a dice in the mirror\n    If anything I could say that this cab was rare\n    But I thought nah, forget it, yo homes to Bel-air!\n\n    I pulled up to a house about seven or eight\n    And I yelled to the cabby \"Yo, homes smell you later!\"\n    Looked at my kingdom I was finally there\n    To sit on my throne as the prince of Bel-air\n`;\n\nclass
