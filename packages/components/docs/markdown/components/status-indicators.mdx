# Status indicators

## Inline error notification
An icon and a line of text to indicate a status below a form field  

##### Usage and guidelines
* Is positioned directly below the form field
* Only contain critical status information
* Is short and concise (1 line)
* Shows what went wrong and what a user’s next step can be to fix it
* It is written in an objective and passive form to never accidentally blame the user. For example: “A phone number is required.” instead of “You forgot to enter your phone number”

## Skeletons
A pre-loading state of a page or element that lets users get used to the general lay-out and indicate that something is loading.

##### Usage and guidelines
* Skeletons are used to display a low fidelity version of the interface before the content is loaded. This improves the way load times are perceived by our merchants. Skeletons give the merchant an indication of what the page will look like when it is fully loaded.
