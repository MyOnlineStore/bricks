# Buttons

## Default buttons
Buttons make actions instantly visible on a page. Depending on the type of action there are several types of buttons available. The most common are the default buttons. You will find these buttons throughout every part of our interface.

### Shape
The default buttons are all based on a rounded rectangle (border-radius: 3px) with a solid -2px inset shadow at the bottom.

### Sizing
All default buttons are 36px in height and have a padding on both sides of 24px. This makes them vary in width and not in height. The font-size of the button texts are 14px (the same as our default text).
